    24/02/2017 - Version 1.1

        - The subtraction of sources after self calibration has been improved
        - The baseline-dependent averaging used during imaging has been reduced,
        as the previous averaging caused significant smearing away from the
        facet center
        - Many bug fixes

    04/11/2016 - Version 1.0

        - Initial release
